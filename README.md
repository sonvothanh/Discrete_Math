Bob and Alice agree to write messages using the 26 uppercase English letters according to the convention: 01 for A, 02 for B, ..., and 26 for Z. Assume Bob's Rabin public-key cryptosystem has the public key n=328419349. Alice encrypts a message M by calculating M² mod n. For example, the word LOVE would be encoded as the number 12152205 and then encrypted as:

12152205² mod 328419349 = 27148732

and Alice sends 27148732 to Bob. Alice encrypts 4 words and then sends them to Bob. Those four words are encrypted as:
249500293, 29883150, 232732214, 98411064.
Decrypt the words above.
